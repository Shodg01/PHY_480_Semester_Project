# PHY_480_Semester_Project

This repo is for storing my progress on my Computational Physics PHY 480 SS24 final project. 

This project aims to explore the accuracy of fourier series and how many terms are needed to be 99% accurate. Then the project goes on to see how the behavior of the fourier series differs from the periodic functions in a damped driven oscillator.
